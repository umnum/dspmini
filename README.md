This is a Matlab and JUCE implementation of a Moog Ladder Filter based on A. Huovilainen's 2004 paper 'Non-Linear Digital Implementation of the Moog Ladder Filter'.
This implementation was part of a Signal Processing mini project at Aalborg University as a part of my Master's program in Sound and Music Computing.
I have recently revised the implementation mainly to fix an audio issue, write a cleaner code, and update the program for the current version of JUCE (5.4.7)
