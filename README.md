### Synopsis
This is a Matlab and JUCE implementation of a Moog Ladder Filter based on A. Huovilainen's 2004 paper [Non-Linear Digital Implementation of the Moog Ladder Filter](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c490/4c04a7be1d675e360409178da71a1253f6d8.pdf).
This plugin includes GUI interface for easy interaction with the filter's parameters and for visualization of the audio spectrum contents.

### Motivation
This implementation was part of a Signal Processing mini project at Aalborg University as a part of my Master's program in Sound and Music Computing.
I have recently revised this implementation mainly to fix an audio issue, write cleaner and more presentable code, and update the program for the current version of JUCE.
